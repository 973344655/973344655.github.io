html 有两种元素

block 和 inLine


html 标签很多  不用管太多  够用就行


link  三种

anchor targets, to navigate within the same page
relative URLs, usually to navigate within the same website
absolute URLs, usually to navigate to another website

<a href="#footer">
 <a href="contact.html">
 <a href="https://twitter.com/ireallylovecats">


 For example, a blog’s webpage can be divided in 4 parts:

a header that is similar on every page, and is the main navigation of the website
a main content, that changes for every page: a list of articles, a single article with comments, an about page…
a sidebar that links to monthly archives and categories
a footer for additional links to less important page

float disrupts an element’s behavior as well as its surroundings
position absolute and fixed remove an element from the Flow
z-index can alter the order in which elements are stacked
