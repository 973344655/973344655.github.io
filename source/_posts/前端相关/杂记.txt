1.web
 一些互联网基本概念介绍

 A browser is a document viewer ！！！！！

2.html5



超文本标记语言  html
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:

HyperText means that it uses the HTTP part of the Internet
Markup means the code you write is annotated with keywords
Language means it can be read by both a human and a computer



html 有两种元素

block 和 inLine


html 标签很多  不用管太多  够用就行


link  三种

anchor targets, to navigate within the same page
relative URLs, usually to navigate within the same website
absolute URLs, usually to navigate to another website

<a href="#footer">
 <a href="contact.html">
 <a href="https://twitter.com/ireallylovecats">


 For example, a blog’s webpage can be divided in 4 parts:

a header that is similar on every page, and is the main navigation of the website
a main content, that changes for every page: a list of articles, a single article with comments, an about page…
a sidebar that links to monthly archives and categories
a footer for additional links to less important page



3.css3
 css 语法
who{ what: how;}

注意css选择碰撞时的优先级  #id > .class > tag


overflow

Several CSS properties allow to disrupt the Flow:

height and width can alter an element’s fluidity
float disrupts an element’s behavior as well as its surroundings
position absolute and fixed remove an element from the Flow
z-index can alter the order in which elements are stacked


css动画



span 无固定表现，当给它设定样式时才出现效果

pre 标签 预格式处理    会保持标签内的格式

sub 和 sub 用来表示次方 或者下标  a^2 或 h2o(水的化学式)这样

image 四要素  alt title  width heigth


盒子中 width和heigth 是内容区大小， 增加padding或margin不会改变内容区大小
